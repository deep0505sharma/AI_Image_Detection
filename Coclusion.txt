First I have performed Data Preprocessing and checked if the dataset contains any NULL values or not.
Then I have split the dataset into training and test dataset with test size being 0.2 times of original.
After that I have applied models like SVM with polynomial kernel with degree 2, Random Forest and ANN, and a CNN model by reshaping the size of dataset to (20,20,3).
The best f1 score and accuracy was found for XGBoost hypertuned using GridSearchCV with 0.70 f1 score on test dataset.
Accuracies and F1-score for other models were found to be 0.80 accuracy and 0.63 f1-score for ANN, f1 score of 0.432 for CNN, 0.83 accuracy and 0.56 f1 score for random Forest.
That's why I have chosen XGBoost, XGBoost with Rndom forest, ANN and SVM for bitgrit submission.
MY Scores:
XGBoost using GridSearchCV: 0.775
ANN: 0.7069
SVM: 0.6233
XGBoost Random forest Classifier: 0.6109
